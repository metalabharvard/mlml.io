title: About
header: We are an idea foundry, knowledge-design lab, and production studio experimenting in the networked arts and humanities. We are located at Harvard University and the Freie Universität Berlin. metaLAB (at) Harvard opened in 2011; metaLAB (at) F.U. Berlin opened in 2022. The offices work together as well as independently.

Like all platforms for experimentation, metaLAB is less a destination than a perpetual work in progress. Rooted in the arts and humanities, straddling scholarly, critical, and creative practice, it is a community of scholars, designers, artists, makers, technologists, curators, and educators dedicated to modeling new forms of cultural communication, creative and critical practice, and knowledge production.

> metaLAB is an *idea foundry* in the sense that it is committed to ideation, debate, speculation, and theorization across the disciplinary grid.

> metaLAB is a *knowledge design lab* inasmuch as it consists of a portfolio of projects that translate ideas into practical expressions, from experimental books and pamphlets to museum installations to software platforms and data visualizations to participatory events.

> metaLAB is a *production studio* because it is committed to bringing together the mind and the hand, thinking and making. It tests out hypotheses and ideas by developing and delivering a wide array of outputs including database documentaries, software platforms, artworks, exhibitions, studio courses and workshops, data visualizations, and curatorial projects.

As an institutional unit within the [Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu/), metaLAB is actively involved in the Center's research efforts in such domains as artificial intelligence, social justice, internet governance, cybersecurity, and the law. metaLAB is physically located on the 4th floor of 42 Kirkland Street, within Harvard's [Graduate School of Design](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/). Because design practice is fundamental to its ethos, metaLAB maintains close ties to GSD faculty, students, and academic programs, as well as to the [Faculty of Arts and Sciences](https://www.fas.harvard.edu/).

## Community

metaLAB is a porous community of experimentally-minded [scholars, artists, designers, technologists, and thinkers](https://metalabharvard.github.io/about), with affiliations and practices distributed worldwide. Together we instigate and manage a portfolio of projects: some we spin up ourselves intramurally or extramurally; others involve partnerships with public institutions such as libraries, archives, and museums; others still involve commissions or competitions. Projects vary in scope and scale from provocations to platforms and weeks to years. Amidst the ebb and flow of projects, we come together for conversation and shared critique, inspiration, and collaboration. That conversation is ongoing and open, and represents the heart of metaLAB as a community.

There are various forms of involvement with metaLAB. **Principals** are staff, faculty, and affiliates with longstanding, formal commitments to a number of metaLAB projects. Akin to the principals in a design studio or architectural practice, they advise on strategic matters. **Graduate and undergraduate student researchers** are typically Harvard-affiliated and enrolled in degree programs within the university; they often serve as team members on metaLAB projects as they pursue their degrees. **Visiting researchers** are individuals who either come to metaLAB as postdocs (bringing their own external funding) or have a visiting appointment at one of Harvard's schools; they join metaLAB for purposes of participation in projects and advancing their own research in creative dialogue with the metaLAB community. **Affiliates** join metaLAB's yearly cycle of conversation and discovery on a less formal basis, participating in weekly meetings, joining projects, and individually or collaboratively advancing their own research and design work.

If you want to know more, send us a note at <info@metalab.harvard.edu>. No introduction is required. We welcome all inquiries and expressions of interest. Perhaps you'd like to join one of our weekly meetings remotely or in person? Or you're interested in a specific project? Or in a partnership with your own design team or research group? Reach out to learn more. And if you're looking for a formal affiliation with Harvard, there are fellowships available across campus, including the program at the [Berkman Klein Center](https://cyber.harvard.edu/getinvolved/fellowships), our host organization, as well as at the Nieman Foundation, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and Harvard's Graduate School of Design, all of which have annual application cycles.
