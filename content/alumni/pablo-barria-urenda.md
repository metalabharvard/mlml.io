Pablo Barría Urenda is a recovering Architect. Having had his mind blown by William Gibson's Neuromancer at an early age, he has since been obsessed with networked culture, forgotten futures, and digital media in all of its forms. He is fascinated by Computation as a medium that combines the power of Industrialization with the malleability of Literature, but fears for the future of the Internet as an open platform. During his time at metalab he was an active member of the Curarium and Teaching with Things projects. He currently works full time as a Front-End Developer.
