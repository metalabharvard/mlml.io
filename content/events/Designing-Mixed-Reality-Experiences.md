**EMBODIMENT AND PRESENCE IN DESIGNING PERFORMATIVE MIXED-REALITY EXPERIENCES**

In the last few years, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have seen rapid development in usability and accessibility. As a result, such technologies increasingly appeal to performing artists who want to explore their creative potential. Unlike the 90s, when escapist ideas embraced disembodied cyberspace, current VR/AR experiences are purposely embodied and connected to the actual physical environment. In this lecture, Joris Weijdom discusses some of the key concepts, such as embodiment, presence, and immersion, that concern mixed-reality design in the performing arts. He introduces examples from his own practice as well as the interdisciplinary projects of other artists.

**Joris Weijdom **is a researcher and designer of mixed-reality experiences focusing on interdisciplinary creative processes and performativity. He is a lecturer at the HKU University of the Arts Utrecht, where he founded the Media and Performance Laboratory (MAPLAB). From 2012-2015, MAPLAB enabled practice-led artistic research on the intersection of performance, media, and technology. Joris currently leads the mixed reality research group of the Professorship in Performative Processes and teaches several BA and MA courses. As part of his Ph.D. project, he researches creative processes in collaborative mixed reality environments (CMRE) in cooperation with the University of Twente and Utrecht University.

metaLAB is partnering with the [Mahindra Humanities Center](https://mahindrahumanities.fas.harvard.edu/transmedia-arts) to sponsor the [Transmedia Arts Seminar]( https://mlml.io/p/transmedia-arts-seminar/), chaired by [Magda Romanska]( https://mlml.io/m/magda-romanska/), and Hana Worthen.
