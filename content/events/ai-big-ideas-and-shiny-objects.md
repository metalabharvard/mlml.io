**AI, Big Ideas, & Shiny Objects**

**March 12<br />
[12:30-2:30](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2019/events/PP81238) and [3:30-5:30](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2019/events/PP103157)<br />
SXSW 2019**


There is so much buzz about AI. What is real? What is fiction?

This hands-on session, led by Sarah Newman, Alexandra Dolan-Mescal, and Jessica Yurkofsky, will bring together tech professionals, creatives, and scholars to explore AI questions big and small, and come up with quick prototypes and creative solutions with unexpected (and yes, shiny) materials.

Steeped in the practice of visualizing ideas, and making complex questions accessible to broad audiences, the workshop will focus on AI's current and future impacts on society, and how to productively contend with and move forward in this exciting and challenging time. Designed for people from diverse fields and perspectives (from the highly technical to not at all technical) to come together, engage, create things, and surface new insights.
