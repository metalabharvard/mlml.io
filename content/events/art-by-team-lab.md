**teamLab** (f. 2001) is an international art collective, an interdisciplinary group of specialists such as artists, programmers, engineers, CG animators, mathematicians, and architects, whose collaborative practice seeks to navigate the confluence of art, science, technology, and the natural world. teamLab aims to explore the relationship between the self and the world and new perceptions through art. In order to understand the world around them, people separate it into independent entities with perceived boundaries between them. teamLab seeks to transcend these boundaries in our perception of the world, of the relationship between the self and the world, and of the continuity of time. Everything exists in a long, fragile yet miraculous, borderless continuity.

A teamLab member will talk about the philosophy and vision behind their creative process, and about their new concept of Environmental Phenomena, which is explored in their latest artworks. teamLab has been creating art using digital technology since the beginning. Although technology is the core of their work, it is not the most important part. Technology is still just material or tool to create artworks. Digital technology allows artistic expression to be released from the material world, gaining the ability to change form freely. The environments where viewers and artworks are placed together allow the artists to decide how to express those changes. The hope is for people to become lost, both physically and metaphorically, and explore the immersive art installations. In doing so, they discover the beauty of the borderless world.
