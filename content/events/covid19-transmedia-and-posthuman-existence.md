**COVID19, TRANSMEDIA AND THE ART OF POSTHUMAN EXISTENCE**

During the Covid19 crisis, technological addiction has evolved into the digitalization of daily life and experience. In this delicate historical moment, the biological body, at risk of viral infection, is reclaimed by the booming of virtualized life. No longer related to work or entertainment, the screen has become our mirror. This talk will focus on transmedia as our existential manifestation, full of potential, agency, and response-ability. This is the time when we realize that our lives, in all of their physical and virtual aspects, are our greatest legacy: this is the art of existence.

**Francesca Ferrando** teaches Philosophy at NYU-Liberal Studies, New York University. A leading voice in the field of Posthuman Studies and founder of the Global Posthuman Network, she has been the recipient of numerous honors and recognitions, including the Sainati prize with the Acknowledgement of the President of Italy. She has published extensively on these topics; her latest book is *Philosophical Posthumanism* (Bloomsbury 2019). In the history of TED talks, she was the first speaker to give a talk on the topic of the posthuman. US magazine “Origins” named her among the 100 people making a change in the world.
