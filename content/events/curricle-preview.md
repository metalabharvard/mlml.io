**Curricle Preview<br />
August 2, 2018, 2-3:30pm<br />
Gund Hall 121**

With Professor Jeffrey Schnapp and metaLAB (at) Harvard.

As the first release of Curricle nears completion,  we are currently preparing for a large scale test of the platform during the fall semester. In advance of testing, metaLAB is holding an informational event on Thursday August 2nd, 2-3:30 pm in room 121 of Gund Hall (GSD).

The full development and design team will be there to walk you through the platform, to describe future plans, and to answer questions.
