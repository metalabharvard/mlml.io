In 2017, the Canadian Arts Presenting Association (CAPACOA) published its digital innovation assessment, “Digitizing the Performing Arts: As Assessment of Opportunities, Issues, and Challenges.” As the rationale for its work, CAPACOA noted that, “… as audiences gain the ability to curate their own content, and seek content on multiple devices and platforms, artists and arts organizations have had to respond to new intermediaries such as search engines, applications, video, and audio streaming services, online booksellers or on-demand downloading options.” As has been widely discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated these trends. With algorithms distributing and prioritizing content to audiences, preferences, tastes and aesthetic opinions are increasingly and often unwittingly shaped by these recommendations. The human recommender, whether a professional critic or trusted friend, is giving way to an algorithmic one. In response, organizations such as CAPACOA are working to make the performing arts more discoverable, that is legible to algorithmic audiences. This talk explores these efforts and suggests possible implications and options for the future of theatre across media.
