This roundtable brings together a diverse group of opera practitioners and scholars focusing on the transmedia flow of opera in the twenty-first century. The global pandemic offered an opportunity for opera to spearhead innovative transmedia storytelling formats that move fluidly across media boundaries, artistic genres, and geographical borders. 

Long considered innovative storytelling formats, site-specificity, VR, and video games have influenced opera in multi-faceted ways, transporting audiences into an “otherworld.” Recently, we have witnessed a shift towards site-specific reimagination of repertory opera (*Twilight: Gods* by Lyric Opera of Chicago and Michigan Opera Theater), gamification of opera (Yuval Sharon’s *Die Walküre Act III*, White Snake Projects’ *PermaDeath*,  *Death by Life*), and a radical re-conception of opera as observed in VR – and zoom – operas (On Site Opera’s *Lesson Plan*, Kamala Sankaram’s *Parksville Murders*, *all decisions will be made by consensus*). Engaging with transmedia aesthetics through the lens of cross-border exchanges, transnational co-productions, and co-creations will offer deeper insights into the distributed mode of creative agency in our contemporary scene today which ventures away from a hegemonic framework.

In doing so, we aim to contribute to new transmedia frameworks in situating opera studies today. Scrutinizing the media integrated into the live productions will lead outwards to a critical issue concerning media as place-making, as well as the intermedial affinities between opera and other remotely delivered compositions in the here-and-now. 

**Panelists:**

**Kamala Sankaram**, Lecturer of Music at SUNY Purchase College, USA; Co-Artistic Director of Experiments in Opera, USA

Praised as “one of the most exciting opera composers in the country” (–*The Washington Post*), Kamala Sankaram moves freely between the worlds of experimental music and contemporary opera. Recent commissions include works for the Glimmerglass Festival (where she was the 2022 Composer-in-Residence), Washington National Opera, and Creative Time, among others. Kamala is known for her operas based in Indian classical music (including Thumbprint) and for work pushing the boundaries of the operatic form (including *The Last Stand*, a 10-hour opera created for the trees of Prospect Park, *Looking at You*, a techno-noir featuring live data mining of the audience, *all decisions will be made by consensus*, a short absurdist opera performed live over Zoom, and *The Parksville Murders*, the world’s first virtual reality opera.) Awards, grants, and residencies include Kaufman Music Center Composer-in-Residence, Jonathan Larson Award, Opera America, HERE Artist Residency Program, the MacDowell Colony, and the Watermill Center.
