**Cambridge Public Library<br />
Saturday, May 25, 1-4 PM**

In a series of three Spring events, FUTUREFOOD is working with local producers, brewers, and restaurateurs to create foods of the future drawn from the natural world around usâ€”the kind of ingredients and flavors we'll need to cultivate if we're going to nourish ourselves and our communities on a warming planet.

**Featuring the weedy ways of nature in the city, with an ice cream made with invasive Japanese Knotweed, cooked up by Toscanini's Gus Rancatore. Come and taste this tart, fruity wild vegetable that ranges up and down our public green spaces.**
