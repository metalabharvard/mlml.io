In a series of three Spring events, FUTUREFOOD is working with local producers, brewers, and restaurateurs to create foods of the future drawn from the natural world around us—the kind of ingredients and flavors we'll need to cultivate if we're going to nourish ourselves and our communities on a warming planet.

**Featuring our nonhuman neighbors, the bees, who are involved in agriculture and flowering lives of all kinds. With chef Nate Phinisee, we'll be making taffy and other treats with local honey—and in conjunction with the science team from Best Bees, we'll learn how to taste the landscapes that urban bees reveal.**
