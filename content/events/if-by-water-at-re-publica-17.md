re:publica 2017 installation website


IF BY WATER is a silent video installation projected in a stairwell. The flickering abstraction incorporates thousands of unique and found images of water. The piece is entrancing and unnerving, and beautiful. There is no all-encompassing viewpoint of the piece; there is no correct perspective. In order to view the piece at all, one must necessarily be inside it, and thus implicated in it. 

Explore the video installation IF BY WATER in the staircase @labore:tory during the whole #rp17. May 8-10, 2017
