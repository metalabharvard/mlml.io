##### "*Anjan Sundaram is one of the great reporters of our age. He writes with exceptional courage and deep humanity. An inspiring chronicler of the world and the spirit*." 
—Fergal Keane, author of The Madness: A Memoir of War, Fear and PTSD



In this upcoming public event, co-hosted by metaLAB (at) Harvard, the [Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu/), the [Nieman Foundation for Journalism](https://nieman.harvard.edu/), and the [Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School](https://hrp.law.harvard.edu/), **metaLAB Affiliate and TED Fellow [Anjan Sundaram](https://anjansundaram.com/) will be in conversation with BBC editor and Nieman Fellow [Ashish Dikshit](https://twitter.com/dikshitashish/) about the personal costs that journalists and frontline war correspondents pay, and the common but underexpressed tension between public service work and the toll it takes on one's personal life.** The conversation will touch upon Anjan Sundaram's new book, [Breakup: A Marriage in Wartime](https://books.catapult.co/books/breakup/), in which he describes how, after ten years of reporting from central Africa for The New York Times and The Associated Press, word arrives of preparations for ethnic cleansing in the Central African Republic. He is suddenly torn between his duty as a husband and father, and his moral responsibility to report on a conflict largely unseen by the world. 


This event is free and open to the public.
