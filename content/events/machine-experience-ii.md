**January 19 - February 4**<br />
**Rainbow Unicorn**<br />
**[Anklamer Str. 50, 10115. Berlin](https://maps.google.com/?q=Anklamer+Str.+5010115+Berlin&entry=gmail&source=g)**



The possibilities of artificial intelligence have long seemed futuristic and far-fetched. Today, however, AI technology is making its impact felt in such real-world realms as autonomous vehicles, online searches and feeds, and the criminal justice system.

metaLAB at Harvard presents MACHINE EXPERIENCE II, a showcase of works by metaLAB artists exploring the emotional effects of algorithms, the uncanny experiences of sensor-enabled computers, and what intelligent machines might reveal about understandings of the nature of intelligence itself. This work is presented in conjunction with the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative at Harvardâ€™s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society and the MIT Media Lab.



**Rainbow Unicorn** is a Berlin based design agency working in fields of art direction and coding founded by Anna Niedhart, Christian Reich and Alex Tolar.

Since 2016 Rainbow Unicorn expanded to a gallery dedicated to contemporary art.
