*Moral Labyrinth* is a research project and art installation that focuses on human relationships to technology, and explores the difficult moral questions that emerge alongside the introduction of new technologies. The work contends with the challenge of embedding values into powerful systems when these systems are created by humans who, ourselves, are inconsistent and imperfect moral agents. The work is grounded in moral philosophy, social psychology, the ethics of technology, and contends with questions that are made particularly pressing with AI technologies. *Moral Labyrinth* has been exhibited in Germany, Austria, England, and the US, and a new version of it will be in Tunisia in June. Newman will share the project, her views about the necessities of humility and collaboration, and offer the audience a glimpse at some new directions in her work. In-person attendees of Monday's talk will receive a small fragment of the Moral Labyrinth.
