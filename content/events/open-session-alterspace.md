**metaLAB_open session: Alterspace**

**March 6, 3-4 PM<br />
Cabot Library Discovery Bar**

Alterspace is a new kind of reading room that lets library patrons control light and sound, adapting conditions for brainstorming or quiet study. Join the Alterspace design team (from metaLAB & Harvardâ€™s Library Innovation Lab) in this open session exploring digital placemaking and adaptive, emancipatory design in public spaces of all kinds.

*Through open sessions in Cabot Library's Discovery Bar, metaLAB seeks to highlight the emerging community making new media and digital scholarship happen at Harvard and beyond.*
