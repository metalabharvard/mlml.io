CGIS South, Tsai Auditorium

**Site Unscene: Medial Ideology and the Literary Interface**

Who speaks in an interface? How do we understand the work done by the graphical, tactile, audio and spatial features of on-screen and ambient works of literary production? The many aspects of language–subject positions and performative dimensions–do not map neatly onto the structuring features of literary work in on-screen and networked media. This paper explores some of the ways the conventions in literary interface produce a range of subject positions that pass as neutral user experience—and how these participate in the larger phenomenon of what Matt Kirschenbaum calls “medial ideology”. In addition, it asks how the contemporary category of “the literary” is identified and produced within its own ideological conceptions and their longer traditions.
