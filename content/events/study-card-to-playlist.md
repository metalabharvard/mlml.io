**Study Card to Playlist: the Social Life of the Course Catalog<br />
November 7, 2017, 12pm<br />
Lamont Forum Room**

With Professor Jeffrey Schnapp and metaLAB (at) Harvard.

Visualized, annotated, connected: what should the course catalog look like in the 21st century? In this interactive lunch talk, members of metaLAB's Curricle team will share details of the new platform they're building for course-selection and discoveryâ€”and invite participants to help design and refine the system. 

**Lunch will be provided! [RSVP](https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/2017/luncheon/11/Curricle#RSVP) required.**
