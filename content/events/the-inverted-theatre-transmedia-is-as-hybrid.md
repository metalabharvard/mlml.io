The last couple of years redefined the way performing arts live. Trapped behind small screens, artists stopped moving, and the shared time/space experience was lost. How did we cope with this? What did we have to say? Did we learn something from all this technology? Drawing on La Quinta del Lobo’s own research and artistic production, this lecture explores the place where media and contemporary art intersect the theater experience and invert the way performing arts are built today.

**Carmen Gil Vrolijk** is an Associate Professor at the Department of Art, Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia.  Transdisciplinary artist and curator, Carmen directs the Master's Degree in Fine, Electronic Media, and Time Art. She has been working on multimedia projects since the late 1990s.   Her interests focus on performing arts projects mediated by technology in experimental and immersive formats, expanded narratives, and the poetics of technology.  She directs La Quinta del Lobo, an interdisciplinary multimedia ensemble of performing arts, est. in 2010. Their projects include a wide range of creators and explore the creative possibilities that emerge from the intersections between the arts, science, and technologies that define our era. Her creative work has been exhibited in the Americas, Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Since 2014, she is the head curator of Voltaje (Art and Technology Salón).
