re:publica 2017 installation website

The Presence of Secrets is an interactive installation that provokes questions around our relationship to machines, and the ways in which our private correspondence is digitally and intractably distributed. What kind of logic or intelligence is beyond or behind this screen? What sorts of secrets do we have? Who is watching or reading our words? The installation brings up questions around emerging technologies, cultural norms, individual identity, and uncertain futures.

You can find this interactive installation on the first and second floor at the labore:tory during the second #rp17 day (Tuesday: 10.00-20.00).
