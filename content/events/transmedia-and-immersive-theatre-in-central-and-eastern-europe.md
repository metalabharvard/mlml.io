The lecture will explore various experiments in transmedia and immersive theatre initiatives in Central and Eastern Europe. Bakk will offer a framework of how to understand these genres based on the level of interactivity or immersion and will also explain how immersive & transmedia productions have emerged in the CEE region and how it can be interpreted through various types of immersiveness or categorized based on their use of media, including the body as media.  Additionally, she will briefly discuss the reasons why immersive theatrical formats may or may not have succeeded and what types of theatrical formats emerged and survived after the COVID-19 pandemic.
