The proliferation of metaverse-inspired cultural activities raises questions about the meaning of metaverse art and its performative aspect. What does metaverse performance mean in terms of extending the human body within constantly evolving technology? How does the body function within both autopoietic and allopoietic processes when participating in highly immersive and interactive art? What is human agency in metaverse performance, and how far does it go beyond art? The lecture considers artists and collectives such as Jaffrey Shaw, Stelarc, Masaki Fujihata, CREW, Marnix de Nijs, Wu Juehui & UFO, Harry Yeff, Cao Fei, Meng Jinghui, Beeple, Frederic Heyman, and CryptoZR.
