Have you ever wondered what the world would look like if we could see the information that moves invisibly around us via wifi, cellular, and satellite? Most of us take for granted the basic functioning of our electronics and the modes of transmission used to move the massive amounts of information that support our daily lives, economy, and tech development in the 21st century.  If you want to clear up some of your own misconceptions about how things really work, come meet the team behind metaLAB's [Swimming in a Sea of Invisible Waves](https://mlml.io/p/waves/) for an engaging afternoon of discussion and interaction as they share some of the creations that have emerged from this multimodal project.  Part art, part science communication, part public engagement, Sarah Newman and her team have sought to understand, demystify, and create designs to visualize the various radio frequency technologies (wifi, cellular, bluetooth, and satellite) that provide the scaffolding for 21st century information and communication technologies. 

Lunch will be provided. Limited space, so please [REGISTER](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfX0vCB_ie1ATejlg3nnSSWD_tY-Yx2oYw_81OKHtlOcC8UxQ/viewform) in advance with dietary restrictions. <u>This event is for HLS ID holders only</u>.
