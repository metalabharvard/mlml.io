Alexandra is an artist, archivist, and user experience designer whose works
aim towards increasing social capacity for individual empathy and cultural understanding. Her encaustic practice explores the inherent faults in the archive and the danger of narratives built from that fault line. These issues are then brought to life through teaching and lecture series within the archival and library fields.

As a user experience designer and project manager, she employs human-centered, empathy-driven, and participatory design models to develop projects that naturally embed themselves within their communities.
