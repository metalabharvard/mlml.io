Alice Cai is an author, researcher, and inventor working in the intersection of technology and the arts. From sci-fi/fantasy novels to creative non-fiction, her writing explores themes of intersectional identity, environmental collapse, and human-machine relationships in an increasingly technologically advanced world. Her research experience involves developing bio-inspired nanomaterials for sensing applications and automated data analysis and particle segmentation programs. Her current work integrates research, engineering, and design methodologies to develop collaborative AI-creator systems, implement these systems into her own creative practice, and examine the mechanisms of human-computer collaboration at large. More broadly, she also works as a teacher and community organizer aiming to foster cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural thinking and collaboration.
