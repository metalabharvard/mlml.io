Antonio Perez is currently an undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Olin College of Engineering. He is passionate about exploring design, language, and education activism. Through a fellowship program at metaLAB, he searches to explore the complimentary relationship between the arts, humanities and engineering. He draws from a mechanical and architectural design background to observe and test this interplay. At metaLAB, he is currently working on an installation to provoke critical thought on loss of biodiversity, and a separate project that investigates the features of machine intelligence through construction of a lifelike mill apparatus.
