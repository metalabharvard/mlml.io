Aylin is involved in teaching and advising on BA, MA and PhD level at the Basel Academy of Art and Design FHNW, and has previously taught theory, methods, and studio courses at Harvard University, Technical University Darmstadt, Boston Architectural College, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Boğaziçi University, University of Basel. Aylin’s work has been published in peer-reviewed volumes and journals, her collaborative work was part of exhibitions in Berlin and Basel. As Berghahn series editor of "Urban Anthropology Unbound," she fosters unconventional perspectives in ethnographic knowledge, exploratory and multimodal work.

As head of research in designXsciences, Aylin fosters and participates in collaborative research that brings together design, technology, life sciences, and social sciences. In recent years, her work has engaged with “urban engendering”, “migratory homescapes,” “agents of urban change,” “dirtscapes,” “an:archives,” “posthuman collaboration,” “care matters in entangled commons,” which she explores through urban and sensory ethnography, expanded scenography, and feminist spatial practice. With the metaLAB (at) Basel, Aylin is currently involved in “Spatial Affairs. Extended Reality Experiences” (with HEK and iart in Basel 2024 – 2026).
