Brian House (he/him) is an artist who investigates the rhythms of human and nonhuman systems. Through sound, subversive technology, and multidisciplinary research, he makes our interdependencies audible in order to imagine new political realities. His current project, Macrophones, explores atmospheric infrasound as a means of listening to the climate crisis.

House has exhibited at MoMA, Los Angeles MOCA, Ars Electronica, ZKM Center for Art and Media, Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and Eyebeam, among other venues, and he is supported by Creative Capital. The New York Times Magazine, WIRED, The Guardian, and TIME’s annual “Best Inventions” issue have featured his work, and his academic writing has been published in Leonardo, Journal of Sonic Studies, and e-flux Architecture.

House holds a PhD in Computer Music from Brown University and was Associate Scholar at Columbia University’s Center for Spatial Research. He is Assistant Professor of Art at Amherst College.
