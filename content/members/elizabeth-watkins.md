Elizabeth Watkins was a fellow at metaLAB in 2012. A misfit scholar, her work has ranged across the fields of media, art, and design. Currently a PhD Student in the Communications program at Columbia University, a member of the Columbia Center on Organizational Innovation and the Collaborative Organization and Digital Ecologies Seminar (CODES), and an affiliate of the Columbia Initiative for the Study and Practice of Organized Creativity and Culture, Elizabeth  is interested in how teams and organizations respond to changing technologies. Using qualitative ethnographic methods, with a focus on security, privacy, and encryption, she's found that organizational culture exerts a critical influence on the adoption of security tools.
