Felix Stenger is a PhD student in the field of theatre & performance studies at FU Berlin and guest researcher at the metaLAB Harvard. In his thesis, he focuses on the emancipatory and liberating potentials of alienation in contemporary theatre & performance by Susanne Kennedy, The Agency, Theresa Reiwer and Mette Ingvartsen. Therefore, he re-reads key concepts of classical alienation discourses in an affirmative framework and brings them into conversation with contemporary philosophy.
