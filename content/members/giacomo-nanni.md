Giacomo is an information designer primarily interested in exploring the intersection of technology, data and design and whose work results in a wide range of methodologies, spanning from data visualisations to investigative aesthetics.

As a research assistant at the ᴜᴄʟᴀʙ, he has been able to deepen and further explore these skills in an academic environment in recent years and expand them to include the aspect of teaching through his current involvement at the Kunsthochschule Weißensee.

Since 2017, he has also been working as a freelancer, which has given him the opportunity to realise projects with organisations and institutions such as the NGOs Airwars and Froh!, Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Academy of Fine Arts Bologna and the Design Academy Eindhoven.
