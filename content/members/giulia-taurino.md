Giulia Taurino is a Visiting Research Fellow at Brown University’s Virtual Humanities Lab, where she works on a data visualization project of the IMDb funded by MITACS. Since September 2019, she is an affiliate at Harvard metaLAB, exploring the intersection between AI and curatorial practices.

Her research combines studies on media ecology with cultural analytics and computational methods in digital humanities. Her most recent projects investigate the epistemology of digital databases and the role of online platforms in shaping cultural dynamics at different scales.
 
Formerly, Giulia collaborated with the research group Labo Télé (University of Montreal), where she worked on a project for implementing data visualization and knowledge design in media studies. She holds a Ph.D. in media studies from the University of Bologna (Italy) and University of Montreal (Canada).
