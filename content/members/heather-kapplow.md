Heather Kapplow (no 3rd person pronouns please!) is a self-trained conceptual artist based in the United States. Kapplow creates participatory experiences that elicit unexpected intimacies using objects, alternative interpretations of existing environments, installation, performance, writing, audio and video.

Kapplow’s work has received government (BY, CH, DK, ES, FI, US) and private (Barr Foundation, Berwick Research Institute, LEF Foundation, MassMoCA, New England Foundation for The Arts, Robert Flaherty Foundation, Tanne Foundation, Womens’ Studio Workshop) grants, and has been commissioned for galleries, film and performance festivals (MIT List Visual Arts Center, Ann Arbor Film Festival, ANTI-Festival, AREA Code Art Fair, Datscha Radio Festival, Flesh Crisis Performance Festival, Illuminus Boston, ISEA International, Kulturmødet Mors Festival, Meetings Festival, Juxtapose Art Fair, MEM Experimental Art Festival, Open Engagement Conference) in the US and internationally.

As a part of ensemble projects, Kapplow has performed at the ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum (DK), Guggenheim Museum (US), Institute of Contemporary Art (US), Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (US), Museo Arte Moderno (MX), Museum of Fine Arts Boston (US), and the Queens Museum (US), and within works by La Pocha Nostra, Paul Ramirez Jonas, and On Kawara. Kapplow is also an active member of two international art communities that produce work collectively: Flux Factory and Mobius Artists Group.

In addition to practicing art, Kapplow is a freelance researcher, project manager, media producer, editor, copywriter, and occasionally a teacher. 

Kapplow also does arts journalism for Hyperallergic and others, and in 2021, co-authored an arts-heavy travel guide to Boston for Emons-Verlag GmbH. The second edition will be available in Spring of 2022.
