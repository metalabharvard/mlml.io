Hyunjin Seo is Oscar Stauffer Professor in the School of Journalism and Mass Communications at University of Kansas as well as founding director of the KU Center for Digital Inclusion. She is also a faculty associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, Harvard University, where she was a resident fellow from fall 2018 to summer 2019. Her research examines how social collaborative networks facilitated by digital communication technologies affect social change at local, national and international levels. She has published over 50 journal articles and book chapters in this and other related areas. Currently, Seo leads a National Science Foundation-funded technology education program supporting marginalized women’s technology access and use. In addition, she serves as the project director for a National Endowment for the Arts-funded interactive visual art project aimed at facilitating conversations about structural barriers and societal biases facing women recently released from jail or prison, as well as their wisdom and resilience in navigating challenges in returning to society. She is also the author of Networked Collective Actions: The Making of an Impeachment (Oxford University Press), which examines intricate relationships between social institutions and agents during South Korean protests directed at political changes. Prior to her graduate studies in the U.S., Seo covered politics and diplomacy for South Korean and international media outlets and reported on the presidential Blue House, six-party talks on North Korea’s nuclear issues, and other major international events.
