Jessica is a junior at Harvard College studying Economics and English and hailing from Atlanta, Georgia. At metaLAB, she works on bringing her passion project Dear Loneliness from the digital to the physical realm—since the summer of 2020, she and her sister and friends have collected over 30,000 letters from around the world on loneliness during the time of COVID-19. Outside of metaLAB, Jessica is involved with Harvard’s Eleganza fashion show and Asian American Dance Troupe, and she is interested in painting, literary criticism, and entrepreneurship.
