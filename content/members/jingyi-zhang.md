Jingyi Zhang is a Ph.D. candidate in musicology at Harvard University. Her dissertation, *Opera of The Future, The Future of Opera*, examines the future of opera, particularly by interrogating decolonizing practices in contemporary operas and reimaginations of canonic operas through the centering of non-western and BIPOC perspectives, site-specific stagings, multilingual performances, transmedia aesthetics, and new media technologies (VR, AR, MR). Jingyi holds a B.M. in piano performance and musicology at Oberlin Conservatory, as well as a double-degree M.A. and M.M. at Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. She has presented at national and international conferences and won the Deane Root Award (2022), and Virginia University Press Award (2019) at the American Musicological Society chapter conferences. Jingyiâ€™s dissertation research is supported by the Virgil Thomson Fellowship from the Society of American Music, and the Sinclair Kennedy Traveling Fellowship from Harvard. Jingyi is currently preparing an edited volume on opera dramaturgy with Routledge, entitled *The Dramaturgy of an Opera*, which reflects her ongoing interest in erasing the boundary between the artistic and the scholarly in opera studies.
