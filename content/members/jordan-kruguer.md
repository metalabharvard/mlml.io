Jordan Kruguer graduated from Harvard College where he studied applied math. In his studies, work, and research Jordan explores problems at the intersections of physics, engineering, machine learning, materials and design. Outside of metaLAB, Jordan has conducted academic and professional research and completed projects in a variety of fields applying concepts in the physical sciences and mathematics to ideas in architecture, urbanism, anthropology, materials science, and computational neuroscience. With metaLAB Jordan has contributed to the design and development of the choreographic interface for the Curatorial A(i)gents project. Jordan's primary research interests are related to applying methodologies from math and physics to find ways of understanding and designing built environments and the systems within them to improve the sustainability, health, and experiences of communities and individuals.
