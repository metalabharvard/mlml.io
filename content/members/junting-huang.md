Junting Huang is a College Fellow in the Department of Comparative Literature at Harvard University. He received his PhD in Comparative Literature from Cornell University. His research revolves around one central questionâ€”how does sound reconfigure spatial-political relations and illuminate pressing global issues about borders, migration, diaspora, and indigeneity?  His academic work is informed by his experience as an archivist, curator, recordist, and digital humanist. With formal training in data science, he is particularly interested in data sonification as an experiential mode of storytelling and knowledge production.
