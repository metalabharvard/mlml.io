Kasia Lech, with a PhD from University College Dublin, works as Associate Professor in Global Performance History at the University of Amsterdam. She is a scholar, actor, storyteller, dramaturg, and puppeteer. Her research and creative practice explore multilingualism, migration, verse, and digital humanities.  Exploring how multivocality amplifies unheard voices and, in turn, changes long-established theories and methods related to theatre and cultures has been central in her work. She is the author of 'Dramaturgy of Form: Performing Verse in Contemporary Theatre' (Routledge, 2021), which received outstanding reviews for its content, critical quality, and decolonizing scholarship on verse. Her second book' Multilingual Dramaturgies: Towards New European Theatre' is forthcoming with Palgrave. Kasia is a graduate of acting training at the AST National Academy of Theatre Arts in Poland and performed internationally. She facilitated applied arts projects and interdisciplinary research collaborations with diverse communities and non-academic organizations worldwide. Kasia co-founded Polish Theatre Ireland, a multilingual theatre company based in Dublin. She is an Executive Director at TheTheatreTimes.com, a global theatre portal which seeks to decolonize theatre criticism. She co-convenes the Translation Adaptation Dramaturgy working group at the International Federation for Theatre Research.
