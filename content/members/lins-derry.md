Lins Derry is an artist and designer working in the domains of human-computer interaction, data visualization, and choreography. The body is often her site for investigation and intervention in the realms of design and performance. Her current work explores how choreographic interfaces can increase the kinetic and spatial interactivity between humans and technological systems. In addition, she researches how scientific datasets can inspire humanitarian responses via a performative process that she calls data embodiment. With metaLAB, Lins researches how choreographic interfaces and data embodiment can be developed toward both functional and aesthetic ends.

In 2020, Lins graduated with distinction from the MDes, Technology program at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where she first encountered metaLAB. Prior to this, she performed professionally with dance companies based in New York, San Francisco, and Montréal, including [José Navas/Compagnie Flak](https://flak.org/jose-navas/en/). With these companies, she had the opportunity to tour across North America, Europe, and Asia. Highlights included dancing at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Oslo Opera House. As a solo artist, she had the additional privilege of performing at Korea’s Modern Dance Festival and the Beijing Dance Festival via her platform, [Linsdans](https://www.linsderry.com/performance-work).
