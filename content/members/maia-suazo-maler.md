Maia Leandra is a senior at Harvard College studying the History of Art & Architecture and minor Computer Science. A lover of color and a mild synesthete, she owes her newfound curiosity about “colorstrology” to her mother’s affinity for numerology and openness to alternative healing mechanisms. On campus, Maia is a research assistant at metaLAB and spends most of her time photographing, innovating, and frolicking to and from different cafes. Maia Leandra can be found on Instagram on her personal account [@maialeandra](https://www.instagram.com/maialeandra/) as well as her blog [@modandbean](http://www.modandbean.com/about/), and can be reached via email at [maialeandra7@gmail.com](mailto:maialeandra7@gmail.com).
