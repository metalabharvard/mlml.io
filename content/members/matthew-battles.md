Matthew Battles is a maker and thinker whose work merges literary, scholarly, and artistic forms of inquiry. His writing on the cultural dimensions of science and technology appears such venues as *The American Scholar*, *The Atlantic*, *Harper’s Magazine*, and *The New York Times*. His most recent book, *TREE*, was published by Bloomsbury in 2017.
  
At metaLAB, Matthew advances an agenda of creative research exploring the dark abundance of collections in libraries and museums; technology’s impact on our experience of art, culture, and the natural world; and the conditions of culture and experience in the context of deep time. This work takes varied form in writing, video, and multimedia installation, in works like *A Bit in the Abyss* (with metaLAB), a multimedia architectural installation for Boston’s 2015 Illuminus festival; and *Your Story Has Touched My Heart* (with Sarah Newman, 2016), an appropriation piece exploring memory and mystery in photo archives.
