Minne Atairu is an artist and doctoral student in Art and Art Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.

Minneâ€™s ongoing project, Igun AI, addresses a 17-year artistic absence during the interregnum following the 1897 British punitive expedition in Benin Kingdom. Minne holds an MA in Museum Studies from The George Washington University, DC and BA in Creative Arts from University of Maiduguri, Nigeria.
