Mohsin is a designer, civic technologist and researcher. His research explores ethics and social justice in emerging technologies. His primary focus lies in Public Interest Technologies and Civic Technologies, investigating how technology influences epistemic injustices in urban communities and addressing credibility disparities among social groups. The goal is to empower marginalized urban communities through emerging tech for self-governance. His work intersects design, philosophy, computer science, and public policy.

Previously, he spent a summer at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center, researching the integration of LLMs in social media. He was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, where he delved into the impact of AI on architectural practice and design, working on AI-powered tools for architecture and studying surveillance technology ethics in urban Global South contexts. During his undergraduate studies in Karachi, Pakistan, he focused on using architecture for sustainable social systems and designed low-cost housing solutions for the underprivileged. He also created a curriculum for critical thinking and mindfulness for middle-schoolers in Karachi, receiving national awards for his socially responsible architecture work.

His work has been presented at prestigious venues like ACM CHI, ACM DIS, Society for Social Studies of Science (4S), Smithsonian National Museum of American History, Harvardâ€™s Berkman Klein Center, Columbia GSAPP, and UET Lahore. In his leisure time, he's a hobbyist musician and a coffee enthusiast.
