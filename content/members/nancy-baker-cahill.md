Nancy Baker Cahill is an award-winning interdisciplinary artist whose hybrid practice focuses on systemic power, consciousness, and the human body. She creates research-based immersive experiences, video installations, and conceptual blockchain projects rooted in the history of drawing. Her monumental augmented reality (AR) artworks extend and subvert the lineage of land art, often highlighting ecological imagination, civics, and a desire for more equitable futures. She is the Founder and Artistic Director of 4th Wall, a free, AR public art platform exploring site interventions, resistance, and inclusive creative expression. 

Her globally-exhibited geolocated AR installations have earned her profiles in the New York Times, Frieze, and The Art Newspaper, among other publications. In 2023, the Georgia Museum of Art exhibited her first solo mid-career survey, which travels through 2025. The Whitney Museum of American Art commissioned and acquired CENTO, the museum’s first participatory AR project co-built by a global audience, on view through 2024. She will premiere her immersive film SEEK in 2024, marking the inaugural art experience at COSM in Los Angeles. 

Baker Cahill ​is an artist scholar ​alumnus of the Berggruen Institute and​ ​a TEDx speaker. In 2021, she was awarded the Williams College Bicentennial Medal of Honor and a C.O.L.A. Master Artist Fellowship. She is a 2022 LACMA Art and Tech Grant recipient. 

Her work is held in the collections of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY; The Museum of Art and History, Lancaster, CA; RFC Art Collection, Miami, FL; and 0x Collection, Prague, CZ.
