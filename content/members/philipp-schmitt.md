Philipp Schmitt (b. 1993, Germany) is an artist, designer, and researcher based in Brooklyn, NY, USA.

His practice engages with the philosophical, poetic, and political dimensions of computation by examining the ever-shifting discrepancy between what is computable in theory and in reality. His current work addresses the automation of perception, and notions of opacity in artificial intelligence.

Philipp is a Junior Fellow at the Berggruen Institute. His work has been exhibited in Uncanny Values at MAK Vienna, Seeing at Science Gallery Dublin, Festival Images de Vevey, and Hello Robot at Vitra Museum, among others, and is part of the permanent collection of the Ars Electronica Center and the MoMA Art Library. His artist book, Computed Curation, was published by Bromide Publishing House in 2018.
