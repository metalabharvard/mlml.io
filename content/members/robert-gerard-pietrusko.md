Pietrusko's research, practice, and teaching focus on the history and speculative design potential of environmental media. His design work, which is conducted under the name of his studio, Warning Office, is part of the permanent collection of the Foundation Cartier pour l’art contemporain in Paris and has been exhibited in more than 15 countries at venues such The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Palais de Tokyo, ZKM Center for Art & Media, and the Venice Architecture Biennale, among others. Recordings of his sound art have been released by famed experimental labels, ROOM40 and LINE. And his current book project, High Contrast: False Color Landscapes of the Cold War, is under development with University of Texas Press. Pietrusko was the recipient of the 2021 Rome Prize for Landscape Architecture and the 2019 Wilder Green Architecture Fellowship at MacdDowell. Other fellowships include ZKM (2011), EMPAC (2011), and UPIC/CCMIX (2000). Prior to joining the faculty at Penn, Pietrusko held assistant and associate professorships in architecture and landscape architecture at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design as well as research positions at Parsons Institute for Information Mapping at the New School, and at Columbia University’s Spatial Information Design Lab. For the last four years, he has been a visiting faculty member at the Strelka Institute for Media, Architecture, and Design in Moscow.
