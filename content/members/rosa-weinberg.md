Rosa Weinberg teaches introductory and advanced architecture and design courses. She holds a bachelor’s of science in environmental policy with economics from the London School of Economics and a master of architecture from Yale University. She is a licensed architect.

Weinberg’s research and creative practice considers how architectural design processes can be used beyond buildings as a tool for speculation and investigation. She explores wearable sculpture and tech and their connections to the body, and more recently human-nonhuman relationships. Her work and her students’ work has been shown in diverse contexts, including Boston Fashion Week, the Whitney Museum of Art and Lincoln Center Outdoors, and has been publicized on NPR and Mashable. In her newest project she is designing and fabricating a functional installation to encourage co-existence with beavers—animals that (like humans) have an outsized effect on their landscapes.

As an educator, Weinberg is dedicated to helping students move past implicit biases and clichés and to working with them to develop generative concepts for their projects. She has developed novel approaches for teaching digital fabrication to both beginners and advanced students. Drawing on her extensive professional and personal network, Weinberg creates rich experiences for students by designing studios in which students interact with clients and subject-matter experts.

Previously, Weinberg taught design at Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Harvard University in Cambridge, and at NuVu Studio, an innovative high school in Cambridge. She practiced architecture at Cambridge Seven Associates and Shepley Bulfinch in Boston. Before architecture school, she interned at Thomas Phifer and Partners in New York City.
