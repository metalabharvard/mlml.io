Sebastian is a student at the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information. His research explores how technology influences and shapes society, particularly through the lenses of human-computer interaction and surveillance. This summer, Sebastian joins metaLAB via the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society's 2023 Internship Program to explore critical and creative approaches to teaching with AI.

In his previous role as a research fellow for the University of Toronto’s Critical Digital Humanities Initiative, Sebastian investigated the pervasive use of deceptive design in e-commerce and social media, linking its current use to post-war manipulative marketing. He also worked as a research assistant and web developer for the Failure: Learning in Progress project and the Knowledge Media Design Institute.

Beyond academia, Sebastian is a member of the Awwwards Young Jury, evaluating the design, usability, and creativity of websites around the world. In this capacity, he helps shapes the future of web design and establishes standards of excellence and innovation.
