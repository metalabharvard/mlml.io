Shirley Achieng Ogolla is passionate about escaping the academic ivory tower by translating her academic work into interactive art installations for the broader public. In her latest work, [AI Oracle](https://ai-oracle.info/), she invites the visitors to engage with ethical questions on machine learning bias in the context of autonomous decision-making in an immersive way. Shirley is a researcher at the Humboldt Institute of Internet & Society, where she investigates the [implications of AI in the knowledge workplace](https://www.hiig.de/en/project/kiwi/) and has a background in Media Studies & Art History from Humboldt University of Berlin, Sorbonne University Paris and New York University. She co-founded collective no:topia, an international inclusive artist collective which emerged from her stay at the Berkman Klein Center in 2017. Their work has been shown at re:publica and Futurium, Berlin.
