I am an undergraduate at Harvard College pursuing a concentration in History of Art and Architecture with focuses in Mathematics and Energy + Environment. I enjoy thinking about the spaces humans create and occupy- physically, digitally, socially, etc.- and how this effects us and the world around us. At metaLAB, I am applying this interest to the Curricle project. I am exploring the site's utilization as a course selection tool for students through thinking about how students interact with their courses, academic planning, and software and how this should influence the development of the digital space that is Curricle.
