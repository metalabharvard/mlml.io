Snow is a Sociology student at Harvard going into her 4th year. She loves working on anything but sociology: workshops, graphic design, video and animation. Snow is convinced that in order to get more people engaged in important social issues, the social issues must be presented in an engaging way. Thus, her projects are about people, communities, the past or present experience of whom can help us understand each other a little bit better. At metaLAB, Snow is working on Curricle, a course navigation and visualization platform for Harvard University. She focuses on the stories behind the history of Harvard Curriculum, and ways to animate that story for a broad audience.
