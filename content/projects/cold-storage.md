[Cold Storage](http://www.librarybeyondthebook.org/cold_storage/){:target="_blank"} is two interwoven media artifacts at once. It is a web documentary—a so-called "database documentary"—developed by metaLAB (at) Harvard in collaboration with students participating in *Library Test Kitchen* and *Humanities Studio 1* that provides an institutional portrait of the one of the world’s largest book and document depositories: the Harvard Depository (HD). 

It is also a documentary short that reworks and updates Alain Resnais’s classic 1957 documentary on the National Library of France *Toute la mémoire du monde*, while serving as a dynamic extension of the volume *The Library Beyond the Book*, published in 2014 in the metaLABprojects series by Harvard University Press. The documentary short premiered at Harvard’s GSD in early 2015; its European premiere took place at the National Library of France in June 2015.
