A project of Harvard University’s Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, the Japan Disasters Digital Archive (JDA) is an evolving, collaborative space for citizens, researchers, students, and policy makers, and a site of shared memory for those most directly affected by these events. The digital archive is an advanced search engine for archived materials from all over the web, individuals’ testimonials, tweets, prominently including content from international partners who are building digital repositories about the disasters. The site not only facilitates searching of materials, but also allows users to create curated collections and interactive presentations on topics of interest to them. Collections and presentations can be shared publicly and enhance the value of the various items accessible through the archive. The archive also features an innovative map that visualizes all materials that are tagged with geographic information in real time.
