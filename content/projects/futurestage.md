 "description": "FutureSTAGE is a global research project dedicated to investigating current challenges and future prospects for the development of opera houses, theatres, and performing arts centers.\n\nWith new expectations for media, culture, and presence in a hyperconnected world, the civic stakes of the performing arts are shifting. In a series of convenings, an international, interdisciplinary team of scholars and experts are collaborating to identify and map these shifts, seeking both the problems and opportunities that arise with new configurations of stages, cities, and publics. Comparing and analyzing best practices and key ideas across a variety of areas, the group aims to produce an annual manifesto/report as reference and inspiration for governments, cultural institutions and arts organizations worldwide.\n\nThe project is coordinated by Jeffrey Schnapp and Paolo Petrocelli.\n\nMembers of Research Group:\n\nMatthew Battles (USA) Director of Scholarly Initiatives, metaLAB (at) Harvard\n\nCathie Boyd (Ireland/Scotland) Founder \u0026 Artistic Director, Cryptic\n\nMarc Brickman (USA) Managing Director, Tactical Manoeuvre\n\nPaolo Ciuccarelli (Italy/USA) Founding Director, Center for Design, Northeastern University, Boston\n\nWesley Cornwell (USA) Harvard Graduate School of Design\n\nLins Derry (USA) Prinicipal, metaLAB (at) Harvard\n\nEvenlyn Ficarra (UK) Associate Director, Centre for Research in Opera and Music Theatre, University of Sussex\n\nMariana Ibañez (Argentina/USA) Chair and Associate Professor, Architecture and Urban Design, UCLA; Co-founder, Ibañez Kim\n\nSimone Kim (USA) Director, Immersive Kinematics Research Group; Co-founder, Ibañez Kim\n\nMohammed Obaidullah (Saudi Arabia) Producer\n\nJay Pather (South Africa) Director, Institute for Creative Arts, University of Cape Town\n\nPaolo Petrocelli (Italy) Research Affiliate, metaLAB at Harvard\n\nCui Qiao (China) President, Beijing Contemporary Art Foundation\n\nMagda Romanska (USA) Associate Professor of Theatre Studies and Dramaturgy, Emerson College; Executive Director and Editor-in-Chief, TheTheatreTimes.com\n\nAdama Sanneh (ITA) Co-Founder and CEO, Moleskine Foundation\n\nAnthony Sargent (UK) International Cultural Consultant\n\nJeffrey Schnapp (USA) Faculty Director, metaLAB (at) Harvard\n\nShain Shapiro (UK) Founder \u0026 CEO, Sound Diplomacy\n\nSydney Skybetter (USA) Founder, Conference for Research on Choreographic Interfaces\n\nJean-Philippe Thiellay (France) President, Centre national de la musique\n\nShahrokh Yadegari (USA) Director, Sonic Arts Research and Development group at the University of California San Diego; Director, Initiative for Digital Exploration of Arts and Sciences at the Qualcomm Institute\n\n",
