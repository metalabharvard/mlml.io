Begun at Harvard's Graduate School of Design in 2011, Library Test Kitchen has taken a multitude of forms over the years. For a semester, it was a pop-up space in Harvard Square called LABRARY.  

Projects have taken the form of furniture, pop-up spaces, publications, programming, services, or digital platforms. Currently, LTK is being offered as a summer 2017 course in collaboration with Simmons School of Library and Information Science.
