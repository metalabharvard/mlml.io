**Animals in the Machine: Robotic Animal Agents**
Register:  brk.mn/animal-agents

Building on the work around cyborgs and the non-human “others,” this talk illustrates the development of several types of robotic animals and insects, from animal drones and animal “spys,” to artistic robotic/cyborgean animal installations. My aim is to begin to discern in which cases a possible animal “agency” might provoke a rethinking of the human-technological-animal relationship. Looking specifically at work such as Korean/US artist Doo Sung Yoo’s animal-machine hybrids, biomimetic “mixed societies” of robotic and live cockroaches, and animal drones and automata, this talk examines questions of relationality, and possibilities for how mechanized animals, controlled by humans and, at times, at their least “animal,” might produce a disturbance that provokes possibility as a dissenting agent.
