The classical, Aristotelian dramaturgy of two-dimensional linear storytelling traditionally used in theatre and film no longer works in transmedia narratives, which in addition to deploying familiar plot-driven structural devices (inciting incident, climax, denouement), often incorporate multiple access points, serendipity, immersion, world building, role play, seriality, and time/space co-presence. The vertical and horizontal structure of transmedia narratives has unpinned our previously familiar dramaturgical concepts, demanding a whole new vocabulary and structural understanding of how meaning is created in the three-dimensional paradigm of multiplatform storytelling. With the Covid-19 pandemic forcing theatre to adapt new technologies and new transmedia dramaturgy, new questions emerge: how are we to analyze, think critically, and develop narratives that use multiple structural and architectural frameworks?
