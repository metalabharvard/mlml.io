The phenomena of climate change and spiraling ecological devastation are complexly intertwined with the rise of computer technology, digital media, and global information networks. As Bruno Latour has shown, the ways in which we think natures and networks are too often governed by metaphors drawn clumsily from theology, economics, and politics. Through a series of kindred projects in mapping and data visualization, video, photography, writing, and speculative making, metaLAB is exploring the ramifications of networks emerging in nature's midst.

Through a series of kindred projects in mapping and data visualization, video, photography, and speculative making, metaLAB is exploring the ramifications of networks emerging in natures' midst.)
