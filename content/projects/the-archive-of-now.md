The Archive of Now is a collaboration between Harvard Libraries and metaLAB that will make Harvard library digital collections readily available for use and remix, and address conceptual questions about archives, digital search engines, and the use of recontextualization and appropriation in contemporary culture, particularly with regard to archival materials. The project, at its core, permits those in the Harvard community (and potentially beyond) to search or discover digital objects from Harvard Library collections, to access a user-friendly workflow in which to combine or juxtapose these images in novel and surprising ways, and then to print these newly created works for large format output.
 
The project is supported by the 2019-2020 S.T. Lee Grant.



**Soft Launch**<br />
March 6, 2020: an internal project launch for metaLAB and Harvard Library community, incorporating a tutorial and an opportunity to utilize the tool. It will be a chance to reflect on the project, share outputs, learn about insights and analytics, and offer feedback or suggestions for further extensions of the project.
