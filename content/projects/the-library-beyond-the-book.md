With textbook readers and digital downloads proliferating, it is easy to imagine a time when printed books will vanish. Such forecasts miss the mark, argue Jeffrey Schnapp and Matthew Battles: libraries have always been mix-and-match spaces, and remix is their most plausible future scenario. Future bookshelves will not be wholly virtual, and libraries will thrive — although in a variety of new social, cultural, and architectural forms. 

Combining deep study of the library’s history with the metaLAB's record of institutional and technical innovation, *The Library Beyond the Book* explores what libraries have been in the past to speculate on what they will become: hybrid places that intermingle books and ebooks, analog and digital formats, paper and pixels.
