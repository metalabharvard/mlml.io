The Opportunity Project (at) Harvard is the College’s premier data sprint hosted by the metaLAB (at) Harvard, as the first campus version of The Opportunity Project (TOP) Census Data Sprint run by the United States Census Bureau’s Open Innovation Lab. Over the course of the fall semester, teams of 5 will build products and tools that use federal data to meet specific challenges of agencies and nonprofits nationwide. Teams will research the problem statements of their choice, design a product (see the TOP toolkit here) through workshops, improve their ideas through mentor office hours, receive feedback via judging, and present their solutions on Demo Day. TOP connects students with experts across Harvard, the tech industry, local non-profits, and the US government to help them integrate federal open data into real-world projects to solve social, economic, and environmental challenges.

This project is funded by the generous support of the Harvard Data Science Initiative.
