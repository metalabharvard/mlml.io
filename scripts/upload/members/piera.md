 Piera Riccio is an art producer and art lover with a strong passion for new technologies and their ethical implications on society.

One of the latest work she has co-authored, [AI Oracle](https://ai-oracle.info/), consists in an interactive art installation that has been exposed in re:publica and Futurium (Berlin) and presented in Italy and Israel. This project was born during her internship at Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society and it invites the visitors to engage with the ethical questions on machine bias in the context of autonomous decision-making for the employment of workers in a dystopian future.** **In 2017 she is the co-founder of collective no:topia, an international artist collective.

She has developed a strong interest in both the world of Art and Engineering from an early age. In 2018 she graduated in Cinema and Media Engineering at Politecnico di Torino and she's currently a Master student in Data Science and Engineering // ICT for Smart Societies both at Télécom Paris (EURECOM) and Politecnico di Torino. Since 2015 she is the art director of FateCinema, an open-sky cinematographic lab that takes place every August in the South of Italy.
