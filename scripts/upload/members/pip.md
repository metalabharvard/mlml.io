Pip Mothersill is a human-centered product designer, philosophically-minded technology researcher and unconventional computational toolmaker striving to enhance our creativity through embracing unexpected provocations and seemingly-irrelevant questions.  Currently completing her PhD at the MIT Media Lab, she develops digital tools for creative thinking that embrace ambiguity to help us get into the creative liminal space where new interpretations and ideas are found. These include: the Reframe creative prompt tool ([http://reframe.media.mit.edu/](http://reframe.media.mit.edu/)) and the Looking Sideways inspiration exploration tool ([http://sideways.media.mit.edu/](http://sideways.media.mit.edu/)).  Pip has presented her work at CHI, TEI, Design Research Society, European Academy of Design, Design Museum Boston, SXSW, Northeastern University and the Royal College of Art.  As well as her academic experience, Pip has several years experience in industry (P&G/Gillette) developing new technologies and upstream product design strategy.  Pip holds an MEng in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Bristol, MA/MSc in Industrial Design Engineering from the Royal College of Art/Imperial College, London.
